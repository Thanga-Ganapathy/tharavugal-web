            This double-sided map has smaller distance errors than any
            single-sided flat map â€” the previous record-holder being a 2007 map
            by Gott with Charles Mugnolo, a 2005 Princeton alumnus. In addition,
            areas at the edge are only 1.57 times larger than at the center.

            It minimizes all six types of map distortions. They used an
            equidistant azimuthal projection: a compromise projection, like the
            Winkel Tripel, with small errors in both local shapes and areas,
            instead of optimizing one at the expense of the other. Antarctica
            and Australia are more accurately represented than in most other
            maps, and distances across oceans or across poles are both accurate
            and easy to measure, unlike one-sided flat maps. Goldberg-Gott error
