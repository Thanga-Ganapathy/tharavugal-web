      'Why the word `தமிழ்` is written as `Thamizhl` instead of standard `Tamil` here?',
    content: `<div>
    The current standard English spelling for the word{' '}
    <strong>தமிழ்</strong> is <strong>Tamil</strong>, which does not
    sound correct.
    <br />
    <br />
    Eventhough we cannot directly map every alphabet in the language
    to the English language but we can get more closer with the
    available alphabets and their sounds.
    <br />
    <br />
    You might also have seen words usage like{' '}
    <strong>Thamizh</strong> and <strong>Thamizhan</strong>. Which
    sounds more close than existing.
    <br />
    <br />
    The word <strong>Thamizhl</strong> is used for non-native
    language speakers to pronounce the word without any bizarre
    sounding.
    <br />
    <br />
    The letter <strong>z</strong> is used to indicate or hint to
    non-native readers that the word contains a different sound.
    <br />
    <br />
    Finally, this is not a strict suggestion; everyone is welcome to
    discuss this in our{' '}
    <Link href="/open-discussions">open-discussions</Link> section.

    their ethical (அறம்) works.

    But you can promote yourself or someone else by sending us an
    email with details. There is no guarantee of approval, but it will
    definitely be evaluated by the core members.
