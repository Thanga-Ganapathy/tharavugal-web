      'Why the word `தமிழ்` is written as `Thamizhl` instead of standard `Tamil` here?',
    content: `<div>
    The current standard English spelling for the word{' '}
    <strong>தமிழ்</strong> is <strong>Tamil</strong>, which does not
    sound correct.
    <br />
    <br />
    Eventhough we cannot directly map every alphabet in the language
    to the English language but we can get more closer with the
    available alphabets and their sounds.
    <br />
    <br />
    You might also have seen words usage like{' '}
    <strong>Thamizh</strong> and <strong>Thamizhan</strong>. Which
    sounds more close than existing.
    <br />
    <br />
    The word <strong>Thamizhl</strong> is used for non-native
    language speakers to pronounce the word without any bizarre
    sounding.
    <br />
    <br />
    The letter <strong>z</strong> is used to indicate or hint to
    non-native readers that the word contains a different sound.
    <br />
    <br />
    Finally, this is not a strict suggestion; everyone is welcome to
    discuss this in our{' '}
    <Link href="/open-discussions">open-discussions</Link> section.
